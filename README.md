- 👋 Hi, I’m @Al-Mizer: Al actually. a resident of the suburbs of Montreal, QC, Canada
- 👀 I’m interested in GURPS and GCS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning How GCS works, because I'm pretty new at it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on GCS maybe, but I'm considering it.

- I'm a retired chemist and electronics engineer now.
- Getting back to into role playingat this point. Gurps entered my life during its second edition and I have most of the books of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th editions.
- So I know GURPS, GCA was getting to be a hassle, so I'm transfering to GCS and I love it so far.   ☺
